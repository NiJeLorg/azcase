Since some of our participants remain in high school until age 21 and graduation is the cut off for the program, it is often appropriate to have some older volunteers as well.  The various programs we offer are designed to help adolescents and young adults with ASDs determine how their interests and abilities can be applied in the work place as they also learn the necessary life skills that enhance their ability to live and work more independently.  The program also provides participants with ASDs opportunities to develop their social skills and the peer mentors the opportunity to develop a better understanding of their peers with disabilities. In addition to the potential benefits from participating in the same training activities as participants with ASD, peer mentors are provided opportunities to develop a better understanding of and friendships with individuals with ASD, while developing leadership skills and further preparing for employment and/or college.  There are also scholarship opportunities for those individuals who demonstrate exceptional leadership skills through diligent service and commitment to raising awareness about autism spectrum disorders.
